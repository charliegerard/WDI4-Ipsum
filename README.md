#WDI Ipsum
---

##A Lorem Ipsum generator using phrases from the General Assembly WDI4 class.


The idea of this project came to me when I realised some phrases were kind of 'famous' within our group and I thought it would be fun to make a Lorem Ipsum generator out of it.

It mainly uses Javascript and jQuery to shuffle an array of strings and generate paragraphs randomly.

The user can input the number of paragraphs needed from 1 to 99.


###Special thanks:

<a href="http://meowist.github.io/blog/2013/03/10/how-to-create-a-simple-lorem-ipsum-generator-with-javascript-and-jquery/">This tutorial</a> by <a href="http://github.com/meowist">meowist</a> really helped me so I encourage anyone willing to create a Lorem Ipsum generator to go read it.



###TODO:

- Probably add more phrases considering the course is not finished yet ;)
- Refactor.
- Add a "copy to clipboard" functionality using ZeroClipboard.
